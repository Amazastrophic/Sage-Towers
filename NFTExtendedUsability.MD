# NFT Extended Usability

Sage Towers is focused on allowing extended usability of NFT's inside the Metaverse. While all NFT's can be displayed, others offer a wide range of utility. Want us to support a new NFT or want to see your work in a Unity based Metaverse, contact us on [Discord](https://sagetowers.com).

At the moment we are focused on Etherium and using the OpenSea API. It shoud be easy to support other blockchains with the way we are setting this up, we would just need to point to another relevant API that supports the blockchain in question.

### Usability
#### Inherited = Native to the NFT's metadata
#### Granted = Additional usage built into a metaverse service
