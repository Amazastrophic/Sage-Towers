### **The choice is yours anon, will you siese the memes of production and defeath The MetaZuck with us?**

Sage Towers is a free, community driven, metaverse experiment that's focused on verified NFT ownership, web3, and realtime multiplayer interactions. 
Our grand goal is to open up as much of our core work as we can to help create the utimate Metaverse that no one can stop!

The first-person sandbox we designed with Unity allows users to quickly and easily build grand towers for a stringhold in the wild metaverse! Relax safely in a place built with frens and memes, or maybe adventure with frens into the wilderness fighting Elementals in a harsh survival world?

Please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sagetowers) to start your journy into some of the most prestigious Realms of the metaverses.

# How we are diffrent
Again, we are focused on **realtime multiplayer interactions** and NFT usability in the metaverse first and foremost. We believe this to be the key to controlling the metaverse. 

Many memes died to bring us this information, but they report [Meta's move to assimulate a company utilizing the same underlying network abilities](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/facebook-buys-game-studio-bigbox-vr/) that we are capabule of. So we have drafted a plan of agaisnt The Zuckerverse Forces. ([Bigbox's POP:One is built on Mirror](https://mirror-networking.com/showcase/) and we use a fork of it called [Mirage](https://github.com/MirageNet/Mirage))

One main speacial attack is that each Realm (Server) in Sage Towers will become its own ecosystem with its own variants on gameplay and blockchaon itergrations. We did not want the core metaverse to be weighd down from high barriers to entry like VR/AR. The goal is for **communities** to fill out the Realms rule set as they see fit. Initally we will probably have to work hand and hand with commnuiotes, but our end goal is to allow anyone to build Realms in Unity and host them online or even LAN.

### Currently we do not require what some might expect in the core Metaverse:
These features would be per realm when implemnted-
- **No crypto required**  
- **No VR required**  
- **No AR required**
- **No Blockchain Gaming/NFT minting**

# Current requirements we do have

- Windows: Plans to support Web, Mac, Linux, and Consoles incoming.
- [Discord](https://discord.com): Login and [Download](https://discord.gg/SMjWy7FMgz)- We use [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference) for login and are approved by Discord to distribute.
- Web3 Profile/Wallet: [NFT support](https://github.com/Amazastrophic/Sage-Towers/blob/main/NFTExtendedUsability.md), always being polished.
- [Whitelist NFT](https://github.com/Amazastrophic/Sage-Towers/blob/main/Whitelist.md): To access the exlusive "Utopia" realm (more open public and private hosted realms coming soon)

## Current Base Game Play
- Perspective: First Person
- Theme: Realistic Fantasy
- Genre: Builder, Open World, Sandbox, Survival, RPG
- Online: User hosted public/private servers called Realms. Focused on 200 per Realm with 30hz tickrate, could scale however.
- Description: Build majestic towers and cities in a mysterious realm to store exotic goods from all over the Metaverse! Allow Sage Towers to be one of homes away from homes inside the Metavserse.

Remember that currently our first realm **"Utopia"** will be open to holders of any NFT on our [whitelist](https://github.com/Amazastrophic/Sage-Towers/blob/main/Whitelist.md), we have plans for more public and private hosted servers soon. 


## Some Lite Tech Talk
We are using a combination of Unity, [open source networking](https://github.com/MirageNet/Mirage), and a server authoritative approach to accomplish everything. We minimize client authiorty over most data and plan to actively improve our implemtaions of mltiplery techniqes such as CSP, EC, and work on extending our scalability to new hieghts. And by utilizing web3 and NFT's we believe we can compeltly replace all of Steams services, getting closer and closer to a true decentralized gameing ecosystem. The metaverse might still have a chance if we can pull all these tools togehter and iterate on them.

# Team
Two life long meme enjoyers trying to make there way around the metaverse. Probably nothing, but who else can offer a one in a million shot at taking out the Zuck empiere? Gaming skills is top of tops. We love multiplayer games. We have also been hacking on the core multiplayer systems on this for almost 5 years now and have unlocked forbidden secrets of the art, if you know you know... and thanks.

# Contribution
Talking with the community in [Discord](https://discord.gg/sagetowers) is the fastest way to help.

Making your own NFT and listing it on OpenSea is the simplest way to work with the metaverse. We will have some open models for other to use as refrence soon.

If you need something mroe custom please contact us and we can build the metaverse with you and your community!
