# [Sage Towers](https://sagetowers.com)
Sage Towers is a free community driven metaverse experiment focused on verified NFT ownership and multiplayer interactions.

Currently open to holders of any NFT on our [whitelist](https://github.com/Amazastrophic/Sage-Towers/blob/main/Whitelist.md), we have plans for more public and private hosted servers soon. We are using a combination of Unity, open source networking, and a server authoritative approach to accomplish this. Users in the first-person 3D open world can easily build grand towers for a foothold into the wild metaverse!

# Contribution
Talking with the community in [Discord](https://discord.gg/sagetowers) is the fastest way to help.

Currently making your own NFT and listing it on OpenSea is the simplest way to work with the metaverse.

Another goal is to allow people to make a metaverse for the community and easily network them using our tools along with Unity.

## Tools we used-
Unity
[Web3] (https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.unity/)
[Mirage] (https://github.com/MirageNet/Mirage)
[Master Server List] (https://github.com/SoftwareGuy/NodeListServer)
