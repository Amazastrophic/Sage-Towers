### **The choice is yours anon, will you sieze the memes of production and defeat The MetaZuck with us?**

Sage Towers is a free, community driven metaverse experiment that's focused on verified NFT ownership, web3 and realtime multiplayer interactions. 
Our grand goal is to open up as much of our core work as we can to help create the utimate Metaverse that no one can stop!

Please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sagetowers) to start your journey into some of the most prestigious Realms of the metaverse.

# How we are different
We are focused on **realtime multiplayer interactions** and NFT usability in the metaverse first and foremost. We believe this to be key to building a metaverse capable of meaningful, interesting social experiences tailored by players themselves.

Many memes died to bring us this information, but they report [Meta's move to assimulate a company utilizing the same underlying network abilities](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/facebook-buys-game-studio-bigbox-vr/) that we are capable of. So we have drafted a plan of against The Zuckerverse Forces. ([Bigbox's POP:One is built on Mirror](https://mirror-networking.com/showcase/) and we use a fork of it called [Mirage](https://github.com/MirageNet/Mirage))

Each Realm (Server) in Sage Towers will become its own ecosystem with its own variants on gameplay and blockchain integrations. We did not want the core metaverse to be weighed down with high barriers to entry like VR/AR. The goal is for **communities** to fill out the Realm's rule set as they see fit. Initially, we will work hand in hand with communities, but our end goal is to allow anyone to build Realms in Unity and host them online or even LAN.

### Currently we do not require what some might expect in the core Metaverse:
These features would be per realm when implemented
- **No crypto required**  
- **No VR required**  
- **No AR required**
- **No Blockchain Gaming/NFT minting**

# Current requirements we do have

- Windows: Plans to support Web, Mac, Linux, and Consoles incoming.
- [Discord](https://discord.com): Login and [Download](https://discord.gg/SMjWy7FMgz)- We use [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference) for login and are approved by Discord to distribute.
- Web3 Profile/Wallet: [NFT support](https://github.com/Amazastrophic/Sage-Towers/blob/main/NFTExtendedUsability.md), always being polished.
- [Whitelist NFT](https://github.com/Amazastrophic/Sage-Towers/blob/main/UtopiaWhitelist.md): To access the exlusive "Utopia" Realm (more open public and private hosted realms coming soon)

## Current Base Game Play
- Perspective: First Person
- Theme: Realistic Fantasy
- Genre: Builder, Open World, Sandbox, Survival, RPG
- Online: User hosted public/private servers called Realms. While we're focused on 200 per Realm with 30hz tickrate, this could be scaled as needed.
- Description: Build majestic towers and cities in a mysterious realm to store exotic goods from all over the Metaverse. Allow Sage Towers to be one of your homes away from home inside the Metaverse. The first-person sandbox we designed with Unity allows users to quickly and easily build a tower and then relax safely in a place built with frens and memes, or maybe adventure with frens into the wilderness fighting Elementals in a harsh survival world!

Remember that currently our first realm **"Utopia"** will be open to holders of any NFT on our [whitelist](https://github.com/Amazastrophic/Sage-Towers/blob/main/UtopiaWhitelist.md), we have plans for more public and private hosted servers soon. 

## Tech TED Talk
We are using a combination of Unity, [open source networking](https://github.com/MirageNet/Mirage), and a server authoritative approach to accomplish everything. We minimize client authority over most data and plan to actively improve our implentations of multiplayer techniques, extending our system to exactly fit everyones needs. By utilizing web3 and NFTs we believe we can completely replace all of Steam's services, getting closer and closer to a true decentralized gaming ecosystem. The metaverse might still have a chance if we can pull all these tools togehter and iterate on them.

## Team
Two life long meme enjoyers trying to make their way around the metaverse. Probably nothing, but who else can offer a one in a million shot at taking out the Zuck empire? Gaming skills is top of tops. We love multiplayer games. We have also been hacking on the core multiplayer systems on this for almost 5 years now and have unlocked forbidden secrets of the art, if you know you know... and thanks for the help to get here.

# Contribution
Talking with the community in [Discord](https://discord.gg/sagetowers) is the fastest way to help.

Making your own NFT and listing it on OpenSea is the simplest way to work with the metaverse. We will have some open models for other to use as reference soon.

If you need something more custom please contact us and we can build the metaverse with you and your community!
