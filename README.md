# [Sage Towers](https://sagetowers.com)
Sage Towers is a free, community driven, metaverse experiment that's focused on verified NFT ownership and multiplayer interactions.

We strive to be blockchain agnostic but are initially focusing on Ethereum and OpenSea for early development.

Currently our first server "Utopia" will be open to holders of any NFT on our [whitelist](https://github.com/Amazastrophic/Sage-Towers/blob/main/Whitelist.md), we have plans for more public and private hosted servers soon. We are using a combination of Unity, open source networking, and a server authoritative approach to accomplish this. Users in the first-person 3D open world can easily build grand towers for a foothold into the wild metaverse! Relax safely in a place built with frens and memes. Or dare adventure into the Sage Towers wilderness fighting elementals in a harsh survival world with full loot PvP...

Making your own NFT and listing it on OpenSea is the simplest way to work with the metaverse.
