# NFT Extended Usability

Sage Towers is focused on allowing extended usability of NFTs inside the Metaverse. While all NFTs can be displayed, others offer a wide range of utility. If you want us to support a new NFT or want to see your work in a Unity based Metaverse, contact us on [Discord](https://sagetowers.com).

At the moment we are focused on Etherium and using the OpenSea API. It should be easy to support other blockchains with the way we are setting this up. We would just need to point to another relevant API that supports the blockchain in question.

## Rigged Models
This should be simple to a degree, we already have a system for swapping models in. Need to assess where the models are stored.
